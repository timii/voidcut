## About

voidcut is a free, open-source and non-linear video editor designed to run entirely in your web browser. With no installation or downloads required, it's the perfect tool for quick video edits.

The goal of voidcut was to have some fun creating a simple tool that I can use myself without needing a subscription, learning more about designing and developing websites, and using FFMPEG in a practical use case along the way. Itâ€™s currently a work in progress and not finished.
