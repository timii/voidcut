## About

voidcut is a free, open-source and non-linear video editor designed to run entirely in your web browser. With no installation or downloads required, it's the perfect tool for quick video edits, supporting a wide range of features.

The goal of voidcut was to create a simple tool that I can use myself without needing a subscription, and learning more about designing and developing websites and using FFMPEG in a practical use case along the way.
